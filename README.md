# Sensory Overload

Our application is a game focused on the user moving a figure on the screen to collect different objects that will randomly appear. When the figure touches an object on the screen, a point is awarded to the player. They will have a limited amount of time to score as many points as possible. Our intended audience for this game is anyone who has a mobile device and wants to pass time with a quick game. This app is useful as a simple way to work on reflexes using the gyroscope sensor and have something to occupy oneself with.
